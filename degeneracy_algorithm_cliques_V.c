           vertices to consider adding to the partial clique during the current
           recursive call of the algorithm.

    \param pivotNonNeighbors  An intially unallocated pointer, which will contain the set 
                              P \ {neighborhood of v} when this function completes.

    \param numNonNeighbors A pointer to a single integer, which has been preallocated,
                           which will contain the number of elements in pivotNonNeighbors.
 
    \param vertexSets An array containing sets of vertices divided into sets X, P, R, and other.
 
    \param vertexLookup A lookup table indexed by vertex number, storing the index of that 
                        vertex in vertexSets.

    \param neighborsInP Maps vertices to arrays of neighbors such that 
                        neighbors in P fill the first cells

    \param numNeighbors An the neighbor of neighbors a vertex had in P,
                        the first time this function is called, this bound is 
                        used to keep us from allocating more than linear space.
 
    \param beginX The index where set X begins in vertexSets.
